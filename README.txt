Introduction
============

``Parse2Plone`` is an HTML parser (in the form of a Buildout recipe that
creates a script for you) to easily get content from static HTML websites
into Plone.

Warning
-------

This is a **Buildout recipe** for use with Plone; by itself it does nothing. If you
do not know what Plone is, please see: http://plone.org. If you do not know
what Buildout is, please see: http://www.buildout.org/.

Getting started
---------------

Because it drives the author nuts whenever he has to dig for a recipe's options,
here are this recipe's options::

    [import]
    recipe = parse2plone

    # core features
    path = /Plone
    illegal_chars = _ .
    html_extensions = html
    image_extensions = gif jpg jpeg png
    file_extensions = mp3
    target_tags = a div h1 h2 p
   
    # additional bells & whistles
    force = false
    publish = false
    slugify = false
    rename =
    typeswap =

The parameters listed above are configured with their default values. Edit these
values if you would like to change the default behavior; they are (mostly)
self-explanatory. Now you can just cut and paste to get started or keep reading if
you would like to know more.

Explanation
-----------

Why did you create ``Parse2Plone`` when the following packages already exist:

* http://pypi.python.org/pypi/collective.transmogrifier

  * http://pypi.python.org/pypi/transmogrify.filesystem
  * http://pypi.python.org/pypi/transmogrify.htmlcontentextractor
  * http://pypi.python.org/pypi/transmogrify.webcrawler

Here are some reasons:

* Because ``Parse2Plone`` is aimed at lowering the bar for folks who don't already
  know (or want to know) what a "transmogrifier blueprint" is but are able to update
  their ``buildout.cfg`` file; run ``Buildout``; then run a single command all
  without having to think too much.

* collective.transmogrify provides a framework for creating reusable pipes
  (whose definitions are called blueprints). ``Parse2Plone`` provides 
  a single, non-reusable "pipe/blueprint".

* The author had an itch to scratch; it will be nice for him to be able to say
  "just go write a script" and then point to an example.

* Transmogrifier and friends appear to be "developer's tools", while the author wants
  ``Parse2Plone`` to be an "end user's tool".

* ``parse2plone`` in addition to its primary role as a content importer, is
  intended to serve as an educational tool; both for the author and consumer.
  Python coding best practices and how to script tasks in Plone are the aim.
  Forking and pull requests are encouraged.

If you are a developer looking to create repeatable migrations, you probably want to be
using ``collective.transmogrifier``. If you are an end user that just wants to see your
static website in Plone, then you might want to give ``Parse2Plone`` a try.

There is also this user/contributor comment, which captures the author's sentiment::

    Parse2Plone's release was very timely as I need either this or something very
    similar - and while I've no doubt I could make transmogrify do the job, it's a
    lot of work for a one-shot loading of legacy pages.

Installation
------------

You can install ``Parse2Plone`` by editing your ``buildout.cfg`` file like
so. First add an ``import`` section::

    [import]
    recipe = parse2plone

Then add the ``import`` section to the list of parts::

    [buildout]
    ...
    parts =
        ...
        import

Now run ``bin/buildout`` as usual.

.. Note::
    The section name ``import`` is arbitrary, you can call it whatever you
    want. Just keep in mind that the section name corresponds directly to the
    script name. In other words, whatever you name the section - that's what
    the script will be called.


Execution
---------

Now you can run ``Parse2Plone`` like this::

    $ bin/plone run bin/import /path/to/files

.. Note:: 
    In the example above and examples below, ``bin/plone`` refers to a *Zope 2
    instance* script created by `plone.recipe.zope2instance`_.

    Your ``bin/plone`` script may be called ``bin/instance`` or
    ``bin/client``, etc. instead.

.. _`plone.recipe.zope2instance`: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/plone.recipe.zope2instance

Demonstration
-------------

If you have a site in /var/www/html that contains the following::

    /var/www/html/index.html
    /var/www/html/about/index.html

You should run::

    $ bin/plone run bin/import /var/www/html

And the following will be created:

* http://localhost:8080/Plone/index.html
* http://localhost:8080/Plone/about/index.html

Modification
------------

Modifying the default behavior of ``parse2plone`` is easy; just use the command
line options or add parameters to your ``buildout.cfg`` file. Both approaches
allow customization of the same set of options, but the command line arguments
will trump any settings found in your ``buildout.cfg`` file.

Buildout options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can configure the following parameters in your ``buildout.cfg`` file in
the ``parse2plone`` recipe section.

Example
'''''''

Instead of accepting the default ``parse2plone`` behaviour, in your
``buildout.cfg`` file you may specify the following::

    [import]
    recipe = parse2plone
    path = /Plone/foo
    html_extensions = htm
    image_extensions = png
    target_tags = p

This will configure ``parse2plone`` to (only) import content *from*:

* Images ending in ``.png``
* HTML files ending in ``.htm``
* Text within ``p`` tags

*to*: 

* A folder named ``/Plone/foo``.

Command line options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following ``parse2plone`` command line options are supported.

Options
'''''''

``'--path'``, ``'-p'``
**********************

You can specify an alternate import path ('/Plone' by default)
with ``--path`` or ``-p``::

    $ bin/plone run bin/import /path/to/files --path=/Plone/foo

``'--html-extensions'``
***********************

You can specify HTML file extensions with the ``--html-extensions`` option::

    $ bin/plone run bin/import /path/to/files --html-extensions=htm

``'--image-extensions'``
************************

You can specify image file extensions with the ``--image-extensions`` option::

    $ bin/plone run bin/import /path/to/files --image-extensions=png

You can specify generic file extensions with the ``--file-extensions`` option::

    $ bin/plone run bin/import /path/to/files --file-extensions=pdf

``'--target-tags'``
*******************

You can specify the target tags to parse with the ``--target-tags`` option::

    $ bin/plone run bin/import /path/to/files --target-tags=p

may specify the following::

    $ bin/plone run bin/import /path/to/files -p /Plone/foo --html-extensions=html \
        --image-extensions=png --target-tags=p

This will configure ``parse2plone`` to (only) import content *from*:

* Images ending in ``.png``
* HTML files ending in ``.htm``
* Text within ``p`` tags

*to*: 

* A Plone site folder named ``/Plone/foo``.

Consternation
-------------

Here are some trouble-shooting comments/tips.

Compiling lxml
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``Parse2Plone`` requires ``lxml`` which in turn requires ``libxml2`` and
``libxslt``. If you do not have ``lxml`` installed "globally" (i.e. in your
system Python's site-packages directory) then Buildout will try to install it
for you. At this point ``lxml`` will look for the libxml2/libxslt2 development
libraries to build against, and if you don't have them installed on your system
already *your mileage may vary* (i.e. Buildout will fail).

Database access
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before running ``parse2plone``, you must either stop your Plone site or
use ZEO. Otherwise ``parse2plone`` will not be able to access the
database.
